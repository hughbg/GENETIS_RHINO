#I temporarily changed the above because I couldn't change Part_E

#The above command could be our problem with AraSim failing; one possibility is to use the flag pbsdcp
#pbsdcp would allow us to copy from the local storage of each job to the working directory without I/O errors, which could be our problem right now since we have so many files being filled at the same time
#see documentation here: https://www.osc.edu/~troy/pbstools/man/pbsdcp
#my thinking is that we would change the outputs/ flag to be $TMPDIR, which is the temporary storage for the job
#then we would use the command pbsdcp -g to "gather" the output file and move it into the directory we want in OSC (Antenna_Performance_Metric)
